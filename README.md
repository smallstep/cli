`step` is an easy-to-use CLI tool for building, operating, and automating Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) systems and workflows.
It's also a client for the [`step-ca` online Certificate Authority (CA)](https://github.com/smallstep/certificates) server.
You can use it for many common crypto and X.509 operationsâ€”either independently, or with an online CA.

## Features

Step CLI's command groups illustrate its wide-ranging uses:

- [`step certificate`](https://smallstep.com/docs/step-cli/reference/certificate/): Work with X.509 (TLS/HTTPS) certificates.
  - Create, revoke, validate, lint, and bundle X.509 certificates.
  - Install (and remove) X.509 certificates into your system's (and browser's) trust store.
  - Validate certificate deployment and renewal status for automation
  - Create key pairs (RSA, ECDSA, EdDSA) and certificate signing requests (CSRs)
  - [Sign CSRs](https://smallstep.com/docs/step-cli/reference/certificate/sign/)
  - Create [RFC5280](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5280) and [CA/Browser Forum](https://cabforum.org/baseline-requirements-documents/)-compliant certificates that work for TLS and HTTPS
  - [Create](https://smallstep.com/docs/step-cli/reference/certificate/create/) CA certificates (root and intermediate signing certificates)
  - Create self-signed & CA-signed certificates
  - [Inspect](https://smallstep.com/docs/step-cli/reference/certificate/inspect/) and [lint](https://smallstep.com/docs/step-cli/reference/certificate/lint/) certificates on disk or in use by a remote server
  - [Install root certificates](https://smallstep.com/docs/step-cli/reference/certificate/install/) so your CA is trusted by default (issue development certificates **that [work in browsers](https://smallstep.com/blog/step-v0-8-6-valid-HTTPS-certificates-for-dev-pre-prod.html)**)

- [`step ca`](https://smallstep.com/docs/step-cli/reference/ca/): Administer and use a [`step-ca`](https://github.com/smallstep/certificates) server, or any ACMEv2 ([RFC8555](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8555)) compliant CA server. ACME is the protocol used by Let's Encrypt to automate the issuance of HTTPS certificates.
  - Initialize an X.509 and/or SSH CA in one command
  - [Authenticate and obtain a certificate](https://smallstep.com/docs/step-cli/reference/ca/certificate/) using any enrollment mechanism supported by [`step-ca`](https://github.com/smallstep/certificates)
  - Securely [distribute root certificates](https://smallstep.com/docs/step-cli/reference/ca/root/) and [bootstrap](https://smallstep.com/docs/step-cli/reference/ca/bootstrap/) PKI relying parties
  - [Renew](https://smallstep.com/docs/step-cli/reference/ca/renew/) and [revoke](https://smallstep.com/docs/step-cli/reference/ca/revoke/) certificates issued by [`step-ca`](https://github.com/smallstep/certificates)
  - [Submit CSRs](https://smallstep.com/docs/step-cli/reference/ca/sign/) to be signed by [`step-ca`](https://github.com/smallstep/certificates)
  - With an ACME CA, `step` supports the `http-01` challenge type

- [`step crypto`](https://smallstep.com/docs/step-cli/reference/crypto/): A general-purpose crypto toolkit
  - Work with [JWTs](https://jwt.io) ([RFC7519](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519)) and [other JOSE constructs](https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/jose/documents/)
    - [Sign](https://smallstep.com/docs/step-cli/reference/crypto/jwt/sign), [verify](https://smallstep.com/docs/step-cli/reference/crypto/jwt/verify), and [inspect](https://smallstep.com/docs/step-cli/reference/crypto/jwt/inspect) JSON Web Tokens (JWTs)
    - [Sign](https://smallstep.com/docs/step-cli/reference/crypto/jws/sign), [verify](https://smallstep.com/docs/step-cli/reference/crypto/jws/verify), and [inspect](https://smallstep.com/docs/step-cli/reference/crypto/jws/inspect/) arbitrary data using JSON Web Signature (JWS)
    - [Encrypt](https://smallstep.com/docs/step-cli/reference/crypto/jwe/encrypt/) and [decrypt](https://smallstep.com/docs/step-cli/reference/crypto/jwe/decrypt/) data and wrap private keys using JSON Web Encryption (JWE)
    - [Create JWKs](https://smallstep.com/docs/step-cli/reference/crypto/jwk/create/) and [manage key sets](https://smallstep.com/docs/step-cli/reference/crypto/jwk/keyset) for use with JWT, JWE, and JWS
  - [Generate and verify](https://smallstep.com/docs/step-cli/reference/crypto/otp/) TOTP tokens for multi-factor authentication (MFA)
  - Work with [NaCl](https://nacl.cr.yp.to/)'s high-speed tools for encryption and
      signing
  - [Apply key derivation functions](https://smallstep.com/docs/step-cli/reference/crypto/kdf/) (KDFs) and [verify passwords](https://smallstep.com/docs/step-cli/reference/crypto/kdf/compare/) using `scrypt`, `bcrypt`, and `argo2`
  - Generate and check [file hashes](https://smallstep.com/docs/step-cli/reference/crypto/hash/)

- [`step oauth`](https://smallstep.com/docs/step-cli/reference/oauth/): Add an OAuth 2.0 single sign-on flow to any CLI application.
  - Supports OAuth authorization code, out-of-band (OOB), JWT bearer, and refresh token flows
  - Get OAuth access tokens and OIDC identity tokens at the command line from any provider.
  - Verify OIDC identity tokens (`step crypto jwt verify`)

- [`step ssh`](https://smallstep.com/docs/step-cli/reference/ssh/): Create and manage SSH certificates (requires an online or offline [`step-ca`](https://github.com/smallstep/certificates) instance)
  - Generate SSH user and host key pairs and short-lived certificates
  - Add and remove certificates to the SSH agent
  - Inspect SSH certificates
  - Login and use [single sign-on SSH](https://smallstep.com/blog/diy-single-sign-on-for-ssh/)

## Installation

See our installation docs [here](https://smallstep.com/docs/step-cli/installation).

## Example

Here's a quick example, combining `step oauth` and `step crypto` to get and verify the signature of a Google OAuth OIDC token:

## Plugins

A plugin is an executable file named using the format `step-<name>-plugin`.
Plugins must be available in your `$PATH` or in the `$STEPPATH/plugins`
directory (that's `$HOME/.step/plugins`, by default).

When you run `step <name>`, the CLI will automatically execute the corresponding
plugin, if found.

Some known plugins include:

- [**step-kms-plugin**](https://github.com/smallstep/step-kms-plugin): Manage
keys and certificates stored in a KMS, including HSMs, TPMs, YubiKeys, the macOS
Keychain, and cloud KMSs.
- [**step-kmsproxy-plugin**](https://github.com/orbit-online/step-kmsproxy-plugin):
Provides an HSM/KMS-backed authenticating proxy for mTLS services. Thanks to
[@andsens](https://github.com/andsens) for creating and maintaining this plugin!

`step-kms-plugin` is also integrated directly into `step` to create
certificates, generate CSRs, sign tokens, and more using KMS-backed keys.
